# Automating AFT Account Customization Pipeline Notifications

# Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

Create a new GitHub repository, for example:

repo name: aft-account-pipeline-notifications


This repo will contain your reusable Terraform modules for:

Event Bridge Rule & SNS Topic

# Step 2: Create Terraform Modules

📁 aft-account-pipeline-notifications/
├── modules/
│   ├── event_rule/
│   └── sns_topic/

Each of the event_rule and sns_topic folders should contain the Terraform code for the respective resource, including:

main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf

# Step 3: Add Root Terraform Configuration

Now, create a Terraform root configuration to wire both modules together. This should go into the AFT management account folder of your AFP AFT Account Customization repository.

repo: afp_aft_account_cust

path: /account-aft-management/terraform/event_rule_sns.tf

This event_rule_sns.tf (main) will reference both the event_rule and sns_topic modules

# Step 4: Deploy via AFT Customization Pipeline

Once the Terraform code is committed from my feature branch to the peorg branch, AFT will detect the changes as a customization step. The Terraform code will then be automatically deployed via the AFT Account Customization Pipeline.
